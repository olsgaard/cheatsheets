# Regression

Find a value `y`, from a set of features `x`

- Linear regression

# Classification

Find a class, from a set of features `x`

- Logistic regression

# Exponential function

The function parameter is an exponent. 

```
    f(x) = a b^x + c
    f(x) = e^x
```

## Exponential Growth

Exponential growth is a function of how many iteration a growth occurs, with base amount and growth rate as constants of the function. Typically this is interests on an investment.

```
    f(x) = a (1+r)^x
```


# Power function
A power function is a variable base raised to a number power.

```
    f(x) = c x^n
```

- `f(x) = 1`,       Constant function
- `f(x) = x`,       Identity function
- `f(x) = x^2`,     Quadratic function
- `f(x) = x^3` ,    Cubic function
- `f(x) = 1/x.   `, Reciprocal function
- `f(x) = 1/(x^2)`, Reciprocal squared function
- `f(x) = x^(1/2)`, Square root function
- `f(x) = x^(1/3)`, Cube root function


# Polynomial functions

A polynomial function is the sum of terms, each of which consists of a transformed power function with non-negative integer powers. The degree of a polynomial function is the highest power of the variable that occurs in a polynomial.

```
    f(x) = ax + b
```

- `f(x) = ax + b`,      , First degree polynomial
- `f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c`, Second degree polynomial

## Machine learning notation

- `f(x) = w_3 x^3 + w_2 x^2 + w_1 x + w_0`

Where `w`, are the weights, and `w_0` is the bias-term, sometimes written as `b`
