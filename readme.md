# Cheatsheet

This is an incomplete copy of my personal cheatsheet.

I think it is a good idea to keep personal cheatsheets with stuff you tend to not be able to recall easily.

Cheatsheets that tell you how to do everything a library does, is not a cheatsheet. It is documentation. I try to add stuff I use relatively often, but seem to be stumped by every time.

Inevitably, you end up adding something and never forgetting it again. So do not take this as a list of things I do not know.
